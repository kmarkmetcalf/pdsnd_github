### Project Title
Udacity Project for Version Control

### Description
This tests my knowledge of version control and how to utilize both git and [GitHub](http://github.com).

### Files used
The files used:
    bikeshare.py is a file with Python code which allows users to enter parameters to drill down into three cities bike share data

    .gitignore is utilized to ignore the large csv files which would constrain system resources

    washington.csv (ignored) is the bike share data from Washington

    new_york_city.csv (ignored) is the bike share data from New York City

    chicago.csv (ignored) is the bike share data from Chicago

### Credits
This project came from Udacity and was combined with the bike share data that Mark Metcalf used in an earlier lesson.
